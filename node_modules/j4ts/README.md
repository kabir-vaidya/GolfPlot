# JavaScipt part of j4ts candy

## Common

This package is a partial translation of the Java standard library (JRE) to JavaScript. 
It contains generated JavaScript code (j4ts.js file) and corresponding TypeScript typings (j4ts.d.ts) of [j4ts](https://github.com/j4ts/j4ts) project. 
The original code is a fork of the GWT's standard library transpiled with the JSweet Java-to-TypeScript transpiler.

From version 0.7.x, the package is module-compatible.

### Versioning

From version 0.7.x, the version should correspond to the original j4ts version. However, for practical reasons, sometimes the patch versions of this NPM package may correspond to unreleased versions of j4ts.
